            The beautifully tempting hues and the rich and irresistible aroma of
            this historical cuisine still work their magic and engulf ones
            senses. Cuisines change and develop over time always leaving an
            imprint on the chapters of history. The subcontinent in the past has
            been subject to many invasions; and with every invasion came the
            culture and cuisines of its invaders. The Turks, Arabs, Persians and
            Afghans in particular left behind the culture of great feasts.
            However, the reign of the Mughals from 15th to 19th century left the
            deepest impact on the culinary habits of the subcontinents
            residents. Being artistic as that they were, the Mughals looked upon
            cooking as a form of art. They enjoyed the finest of foods and
            enhanced their flavors with the use of exotic spices. It is largely
            concluded that the Mughals introduced to the region specialties such
            as Biryani and Kebabs which although still special, became household
            cuisines in Indian and Pakistan.
